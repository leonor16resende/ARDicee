This project was done in the iOS 11 & Swift 4: The Complete iOS development bootcamp. 

This app uses Apple ARKit, which means that is only compatible with Apple devices with an A9 chip or a more recent one.

## What it is?
This is an augmented reality app!s

Once the app detects a horizontal surface, the user can tap into that plane to add a dice to the virtual scene. Then, the user can either shake the phone or tap the refresh button to roll all the dices in the scene. Finally, the user can also delete all the dices, by tapping the button to do so.
